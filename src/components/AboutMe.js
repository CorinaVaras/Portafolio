			I graduated of Business Administration at Universidad de Tecnolog√≠a de los Llanos in Venezuela. I worked in the administration world for over 4 years where I learned about collaborative work, planification and decisionmaking. In 2019 I took a couple of courses about basic programming and immediately fell in love with technology, then I decided to start my journey on web development. I signed up into Laboratoria's bootcamp where I improved my logical thinking, creativity and self-learning ability. As a professional I'm very responsable, willing to learn new experiences and lover of new challenges.
